              #Rate-my-LandLord
*An app to rate and post comment about your landlord*

Its currently not function properly because of some techinical issues.
FOr now we need to install dependencies (npm-install & bundle install)



This app allows users to create comments and rate their landlords after creating an account and signing in. Signed-in users can view all their own comments and landlords.
Signed in users can see a list of their own comments and *click on them to edit or delete*. Signed in users can also edit and delete their own landlords.

For future iterations, I would like to incorporate google map api to allow users to locate their landlord address with google map.
